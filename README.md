# Computer Vision Detection Using YOLOv5 Machine Learning

## Objective
In our current day firearms and other weaponry is becoming more and more common, being used for both lawful and unlawful ends. A wholly reactive response
is unsatisfactory and so, prevention is key. And a major part of that prevention? Detection. There should be little doubt of a present threat.

## Methodology
Using a training set of 11,000 images, 25% of which are filtered through sustantial adversarial noise, we have trained a neural network utilizing the YOLOv5
object detection algorithm to spot and highlight knives and pistols with an average 81% accuracy.
